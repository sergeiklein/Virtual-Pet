Virtual Pets Re-Imagined
Created by Michaela Young, Trey Crumrine, Sergei Klein

Welcome!

HOW TO START:
Player is prompted to first create a Pet1 and can choose Organic or Robotic. 
They can label the species/brand of robot and then name it.

HOW TO INTERACT:
This takes the player to a menu where the player can interact with the Pet1 they just created, however much they want to go back and forth between each prompt and option.
They can feed it, play with it, take it to the doctor, see the status levels change each time they choose an interaction.
The player can also visit the Pet Sanctuary whenever they please.

PET SANCTUARY:
The player can now go back and forth between the Pet1 Menu options to interact with the pet they created, OR they can create more pets, as many as they would like, choosing between Organic and Robotic. 
They player can interact (Feed, Play, Doctor) one pet that they select, OR interact with all the pets that have been created so far. 
The player may remove any pets that have been previously created by the player. 



Depending on which option the player chooses when prompted, and depending on what the player actually types in, there are many different responses. 
The player may play by creating, interacting, removing pets as long as they wish and may exit the game anytime.
